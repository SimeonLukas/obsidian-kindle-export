### Introduction
I was using Calibre and Pandoc-Export plugin, but I was wondering about a short way to export your .md files in one command and add all embedded files. So you dont have to use a .pdf file. The plugin creates a *Kindle: Export* command, which sends all embedded images and .md files to a PHP backend ([Host your own private PHP Backend!](https://github.com/SimeonLukas/Obsidian2Kindle)) which converts it to a .epub file and sends it via email to your Kindle/PocketBook. If you are not hosting on your own, you will send private data to my server. Please be aware of this. I won't save or read your data!

### New open Backend:
https://md2epub.staneks.de/

### To Do's:
- [x] Export images
- [x] Export embedded .md files
- [x] Export embedded .mp3 files (Pocketbook)
- [x] Obsidian cover for the books --> Due to the .epub format, the cover will not appear on the bookshelf
- [x] Table of contents
- [x] ```<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>``` is working
- [x] ```%%Excludes%%``` are invisible
- [x] External links
- [x] External embedded images
- [x] Exclude metadata
- [x] Become a Communityplugin ðŸŽ‰ 
 - [x] Create workaround for other embedded files
 - [x] Add ==highlighting==
 - [x] .epub export
- [x] Footnotes
- [ ] Foldercover or filecover
- [ ] .html export (Archive)
- [ ] .pdf export (would be nice for IOS & Android)
### Extra features (no kindle data needed)
- [x] .md export _(mergedown)_
     - [x] Audio export
     - [x] Video export
     - [x] define own exportpath
### Just try it!
For embedding local images, please use the following format:
``` ![[image.jpg]] ```

Fill in your data for your Kindle/PocketBook and your mailadress.
Read your notes on your Kindle/PocketBook.

**Mergedown:**
Combine all your embedded images and .md files in one .md file.

If you have problems with the plugin, please let me know.
